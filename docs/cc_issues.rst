Troubleshooting Common Issues
=========
Accessibility Issues
-----
**The coffea-casa server won't load, I get an error when trying to access the page, or I'm told there are certificate issues.**

There's a plethora of issues which seem specific to certain web browsers. If you run into any of these, please attempt to open coffea-casa in a different browser. Should this still fail, open a new issue.

If opening coffea-casa in a new browser solves the issue, you are still encouraged to provide information within `this issue <https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa/issues/93/>`_ to help us gather data.

Runtime Issues
-----
**The terminal appears to terminate without an error, or I have noticed strange "core.####" files within my file browser.**

If your terminal is terminating without errors, please check for the aforementioned core files within your file browser. If they are present, then you are generating core dumps. In either case, report an issue on GitHub specifying what you are trying to do, which step is going wrong, and whether you are getting core dumps. This will help us pinpoint what's going wrong.
