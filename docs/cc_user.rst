First Steps at Coffea-Casa
=========
Prerequisites
-----
The primary mode of analysis with coffea-casa is `coffea <https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/index.html>`_. Coffea provides plenty of examples to users in its `documentation <https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/examples.html>`_. A good starting point may be `this tutorial <https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa-tutorials/blob/master/analysis/analysis_tutorial.ipynb>`_ on columnar analysis in coffea.

Knowledge of `Python <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ is also assumed. Standard coffea analyses are contained within `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_, which allow for dynamic, block-by-block execution of code. Coffea-casa employs the `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html>`_ interface. JupyterLab is designed for hosting Jupyter Notebooks on the web, and permits the usage of additional features within its environment, including Git access, compatibility with cluster computing tools, and much, much more.

If you aren't familiar with any of these tools, please click on the links above for additional resources, and get acquainted with how they work. If you want examples of how coffea-casa merges these tools, refer to the gallery of coffea-casa examples.

Using Git in the Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska
-----

Cloning a repository in the Coffea-casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska is simple, though it can be a little confusing because it is spread across two tabs in the sidebar: the *File Browser* and the *Git* tabs.

In order to clone a repository, first go to the Git tab. It should look like this:

.. image:: _static/git.png
   :alt: The Git tab at Coffea-casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

Simply click the appropriate button (initialize a repository, or clone a repository) and you'll be hooked up to GitHub. This should then take you to the *File Browser* tab, which is where you can see all of the repositories you have cloned in your JupyterLab instance. The File Browser should look like this:

.. image:: _static/browser.png
   :alt: The File Browser tab at Coffea-casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

If you wish to change repositories, simply click the folder button to enter the root directory. If you are in the root directory, the Git tab will reset and allow you to clone another repository.

If you wish to commit, push, or pull from the repository you currently have active in the File Browser, then you can return to the Git tab. It should change to look like this, so long as you have a repository open in the File Browser:

.. image:: _static/git2.png
   :alt: The Git tab at Coffea-casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska, after a repository is activated
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

The buttons in the top right allow for pulling and pushing respectively. When you have edited files in a directory, they will show up under the *Changed* category, at which point you can hit the **+** to add them to a commit (at which point they will show up under *Staged*). Filling out the box at the bottom of the sidebar will file your commit, and prepare it for you to push.

Example
-----
In this example (which corresponds to `ADL Benchmark 1 <https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa-tutorials/blob/master/examples/example1.ipynb>`_), we'll try to run a simple analysis example on the Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility. We will use the ``coffea_casa`` wrapper library, which allows use of pre-configured settings for HTCondor configuration and Dask scheduler/worker images.

Our goal in this `toy` analysis is to plot the missing transverse energy (*MET*) of all events from a sample dataset; this data was converted from 2012 CMS Open Data (17 GB, 54 million events), and is available in public EOS (root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/root-eos/benchmark/Run2012B_SingleMu.root).

First, we need to import the ``coffea`` libraries used in this example:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from coffea import hist
    from coffea.analysis_objects import JaggedCandidateArray
    import coffea.processor as processor
    %matplotlib inline
    
To select the aforementioned data in a coffea-friendly syntax, we employ a dictionary of datasets, where each dataset (key) corresponds to a list of files (values):

.. code-block:: python

    fileset = {'SingleMu' : ["root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/root-eos/benchmark/Run2012B_SingleMu.root"]}

Coffea provides the coffea.processor module, where users may write their analysis code without worrying about the details of efficient parallelization, assuming that the parallelization is a trivial map-reduce operation (e.g., filling histograms and adding them together).

.. code-block:: python

    # This program plots an event-level variable (in this case, MET, but switching it is as easy as a dict-key change). It also demonstrates an easy use of the book-keeping cutflow tool, to keep track of the number of events processed.
    # The processor class bundles our data analysis together while giving us some helpful tools.  It also leaves looping and chunks to the framework instead of us.
    class Processor(processor.ProcessorABC):
      def __init__(self):
          # Bins and categories for the histogram are defined here. For format, see https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/stubs/coffea.hist.hist_tools.Hist.html && https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/stubs/coffea.hist.hist_tools.Bin.html
          dataset_axis = hist.Cat("dataset", "")
          MET_axis = hist.Bin("MET", "MET [GeV]", 50, 0, 100)

          # The accumulator keeps our data chunks together for histogramming. It also gives us cutflow, which can be used to keep track of data.
          self._accumulator = processor.dict_accumulator({
              'MET': hist.Hist("Counts", dataset_axis, MET_axis),
              'cutflow': processor.defaultdict_accumulator(int)
              })

      @property
      def accumulator(self):
        return self._accumulator

      def process(self, events):
        output = self.accumulator.identity()

        # This is where we do our actual analysis. The dataset has columns similar to the TTree's; events.columns can tell you them, or events.[object].columns for deeper depth.
        dataset = events.metadata["dataset"]
        MET = events.MET.pt

        # We can define a new key for cutflow (in this case 'all events'). Then we can put values into it. We need += because it's per-chunk (demonstrated below)
        output['cutflow']['all events'] += MET.size
        output['cutflow']['number of chunks'] += 1

        # This fills our histogram once our data is collected. The hist key ('MET=') will be defined in the bin in __init__.
        output['MET'].fill(dataset=dataset, MET=MET.flatten())
        return output

      def postprocess(self, accumulator):
        return accumulator


With our data in our fileset variable and our processor ready to go, we simply need to connect to the Dask Labextention-powered cluster available within the Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska. This can be done by dragging the scheduler into the notebook, or by manually typing the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from dask.distributed import Client
    client = Client("tls://localhost:8786")

Then we bundle everything up to run our job, making use of the Dask executor. To do this, we must point to a client within executor_args.

.. code-block:: python

    output = processor.run_uproot_job(fileset=fileset,
                      treename="Events",
                      processor_instance=Processor(),
                      executor=processor.dask_executor,
                      executor_args={'client': client, 'nano': True},
                      chunksize=250000)

The final step is to generates a 1D histogram from the data output to the 'MET' key. fill_opts are optional arguments to fill the graph (default is a line).

.. code-block:: python

    hist.plot1d(output['MET'], overlay='dataset', fill_opts={'edgecolor': (0,0,0,0.3), 'alpha': 0.8})

As a result you should see next plot:

Important Note for CMS Data
-----
Above, we used a public data file to run through our example. If your analysis makes use of CMS data, or data which is otherwise certificate-protected, you will run into authentication errors. The Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility @ T2 Nebraska comes equipped with xcache tokens that permit you to access this data, but you will need to edit the path you're using to access the root file by changing the redirector portion to ``xache``. For example:

``root://`` **xrootd.unl.edu** ``//eos/cms/store/mc/RunIIAutumn18NanoAODv7/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-amcatnloFXFX-pythia8/NANOAODSIM/Nano02Apr2020_102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v21_ext2-v1/260000/47DA174D-9F5A-F745-B2AA-B9F66CDADB1A.root``

becomes

``root://`` **xcache** ``//eos/cms/store/mc/RunIIAutumn18NanoAODv7/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-amcatnloFXFX-pythia8/NANOAODSIM/Nano02Apr2020_102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v21_ext2-v1/260000/47DA174D-9F5A-F745-B2AA-B9F66CDADB1A.root``
