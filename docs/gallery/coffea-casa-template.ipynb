It is what we send to our executor, which forwards it to our workers. For detailed instructions on how to create the processor class, see the Coffea examples and documentation, or refer to the benchmarks and analysis in this repository. In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__`: This is where we define our histograms. Categorical or sparse axes (*Cats*) split data vertically, into different categories. Bin or dense axes (*Bins*) split data horizontally, into the 'bars' of the histogram. We also define an accumulator here. Data that is fed to the Processor is split into chunks, and we need to add all of these chunks together to get a histogram of **all** chunks. The accumulator is a tool that allows us to do this, by enabling easy object addition; i.e., \\[AwkwardArray1\\] + \\[AwkwardArray2\\] = \\[AwkwardArray1 + AwkwardArray2\\].\n",

For a primer on columnar analysis, see the benchmarks and analysis in this repository, or the Coffea documentation's examples.\n",

The Dask executor (`dask_executor`), however, is more sophisticated for cluster computing, and coffea-casa enables its usage.\n",

See the run_uproot_job [documentation](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/api/coffea.processor.run_uproot_job.html). At minimum, we need to point to a Dask scheduler (`'client': client`) if we're using the Dask executor; we do not need to do this for the futures or iterative executor. If you're using NanoEvents, then you need to say so (`'schema': processor.NanoAODSchema`).\n",

    "`chunksize`: Coffea will split your data into chunks with this many events. If your data has a million events and your chunksize is 250000, you'll have four chunks. There is also a `maxchunks` argument you can put in, which will stop the analysis after a certain number of chunks are reached. In other words, `maxchunks=2` will only process 500000 events of your million. This can be useful for debugging."
