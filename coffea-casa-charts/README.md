# Coffea-casa Helm Charts


[Helm](https://helm.sh) is needed to be installed to use the `coffea-casa-charts` charts.
(please check Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started).

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
helm repo add coffea-casa https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea-casa
```

You can then run `helm search repo coffea-casa` to see the charts.
