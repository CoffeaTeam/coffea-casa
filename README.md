coffea-casa - Columnar Object Framework For Effective Analysis
=========================================================

(to be deployed on UNL Tier3)

The prototype analysis facility provides services for “low latency columnar analysis”, enabling rapid processing of data in a column-wise fashion. These services, based on Dask and Jupyter notebooks, aim to dramatically lower time for analysis and provide an easily-scalable and user-friendly computational environment that will simplify, facilitate, and accelerate the delivery of HEP results. The facility is built on top of a local Kubernetes cluster and integrates dedicated resources with resources allocated via fairshare through the local HTCondor system. In addition to the user-facing interfaces such as Dask, the facility also manages access control through single-sign-on and authentication & authorization for data access. The notebooks include simple HEP analysis examples, managed interactively in a Jupyter notebook and scheduled on Dask workers and accessing both public and protected data.
