About Coffea-casa
-----------------

The prototype analysis facility provides services for “low latency columnar analysis”, enabling rapid processing of data in a column-wise fashion. These services, based on Dask and Jupyter notebooks, aim to dramatically lower time for analysis and provide an easily-scalable and user-friendly computational environment that will simplify, facilitate, and accelerate the delivery of HEP results. The facility is built on top of a Kubernetes cluster and integrates dedicated resources with resources allocated via fairshare through the local HTCondor system. In addition to the user-facing interfaces such as Dask, the facility also manages access control through single-sign-on and authentication & authorization for data access. The notebooks in this repository and ![Coffea-casa tutorials](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa-tutorials) include simple HEP analysis examples, managed interactively in a Jupyter notebook and scheduled on Dask workers and accessing both public and protected data.

Helm charts, `coffea_casa` package and Docker image tags
-----------------

This repository uses GitHub Actions to build images, run tests, and push charts, python package to PyPI and images to DockerHub (Docker images, charts and python package tags are syncronised with Coffea-casa releases).

1. Tags pushed to GitHub trigger Docker image published with corresponding tags on Dockerhub: `coffeateam/coffea-casa:x.x.x` and `coffeateam/coffea-casa-analysis:x.x.x`.
Tags pushed to GitHub as well trigger Docker image published with corresponding tags on Openscience Harbor Registry: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/coffea-casa:x.x.x` and `hub.opensciencegrid.org/coffea-casa-analysis:x.x.x`. 
The `latest` tag in both cases also corresponds to the most recent GitHub tag.

2. Tags pushed to GitHub trigger Helm charts releases with corresponding Helm Chart tag and with charts published to https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea-casa.

3. Tags pushed to GitHub will push `coffea_casa` python package to PyPI (same as a tag).


How to tag
-----------------

A list of "must" steps to do before to tag:

1. Tag Docker images `coffeateam/coffea-casa:x.x.x` and `coffeateam/coffea-casa-analysis:x.x.x` changing `$TAG` value in https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa/blob/master/docker/coffea-casa/Dockerfile and https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa/blob/master/docker/coffea-casa-analysis/Dockerfile

2. Tag Helm Chart's changing `$appVersion` value in Charts.yaml file in see https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa/blob/master/charts/coffea-casa/Chart.yaml

3. Add new tag: https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa/releases


Please note we are using ![date-based versioning](https://calver.org/) for Coffea-casa Docker images, Helm charts and Pypi module.
